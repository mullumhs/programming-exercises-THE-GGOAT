PROJECT 02: VARIABLES
===============================================================================
Objective:
- Understand and practice declaring variables and manipulating string data.

Main Tasks:
1. Create a string variable and assign it a value.
2. Output a message that contains this variable.
3. Make the program wait for input.

Questions:
1. What is a variable?
somthing thats value can be change or be anything
2. What is a string?

Extension Tasks:
1. Try creating two string variables and using them in the same message.
2. Use Google to work out how to change a variable to uppercase or lowercase before outputting it.

Feedback on your C# Programming Task

Code:

Your code is well-structured and follows the basic structure of a C# console application.
You have correctly declared a string variable and assigned it a value.
You have also correctly used the variable in a console output operation.
However, you did not complete the extension tasks. Try creating two string variables and using them in the same message. Also, use Google to work out how to change a variable to uppercase or lowercase before outputting it.
Code Commenting:

Your code is missing comments. It's a good practice to include comments that explain what your code is doing. This will be especially helpful as your code gets more complex.
Answers to Questions:

Your answer to what a variable is correct but could be more detailed. For example, you could mention that a variable is a storage location in memory that holds a value which can be changed during program execution.
You did not answer the question about what a string is. A string in C# is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
Extension Tasks:

You did not complete the extension tasks. Remember to always attempt these tasks as they are designed to help you further understand the topic.
Keep practicing and exploring more concepts in C#. Your progress is commendable.
